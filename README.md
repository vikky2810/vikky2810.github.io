This portfolio website is designed for EngineerVikky to showcase their work, projects, and blog. The website has a simple and clean layout with a navigation bar and a logo.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the content of the website.
- `style.css`: The main CSS file that defines the styles for the website.
- `src/`: This directory contains additional resources, such as images and fonts.
- `Fonts/`: This directory holds custom fonts used in the project.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/EngineerVikky-Portfolio.git
    ```

2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to view the website.

## Customization

### Changing Logo

Replace the current logo with your own by replacing the image file located at `src/images/enginner_viks.png`.

### Updating Navigation Links

Modify the links in the navigation bar by updating the `href` attribute in the `<a>` tags inside the `<div class="nav">` section in `index.html`.

### Customizing Styles

Feel free to customize the styles in `style.css` to match your preferences. You can change colors, fonts, and layout properties to make the portfolio reflect your personal style.

### Adding Content
